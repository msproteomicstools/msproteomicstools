class TreeConsensusAlignment():
    """ Multiple run alignment using a minimum spanning tree (MST).

    This class will align features across multiple runs using a strictly local
    approach. It uses a minimum spanning tree (MST) as input which is expected
    to allow traversal of all runs, only connecting the most similar runs. This
    should allow accurate local alignment between two very similar runs and
    transfer of identification with high accuracy. Specifically, this should
    for scalability to a large number of dissimilar runs where approaches that
    rely on a single reference run for alignment might give less accurate
    results.

    Briefly, the algorithm will choose the best scoring peakgroup as a seed and
    start to traverse the MST from this seed. At each node, it will add the
    best matching peakgroup (by score, within a specified retention time
    window) to the result. After traversing all nodes, a new seed can be chosen
    among the peakgroups not yet belonging to a cluster and the process can be
    repeated to produce multiple clusters.

    For example, consider a case of 5 LC-MS/MS runs where 6 different feature
    (peakgroups) were found in each run (not all peakgroups were found in all
    runs)::

        Run 1:
        ---------- pg1_1 ------- pg1_2 --- pg1_3 - pg1_4 --------- pg1_5 ------- pg1_6

        Run 2:
        ----------- pg2_1 ------- pg2_2 --- pg2_3 - pg2_4 --------- pg2_5 ------ pg2_6

        Run 3:
        ----- pg3_0 ---------- pg3_1 ---- pg3_2 - pg3_3 - pg3_4 ----- pg3_5 ---- pg3_6

        Run 4:
        ----------- pg4_0 ---------- pg4_1 ------- pg4_2 --- pg4_3 - pg4_4 --------- pg4_5

        Run 5:
        -- pg5_0 ---------- pg5_1 ------- pg5_2 --- pg5_3 - pg5_4 --------- pg5_5 


    Assume that the corresponding MST looks like this::

                               /-- Run4
        Run1 -- Run2 -- Run3 --
                               \-- Run5

    This is a case where Run1 and Run2 are very similar and Run3 and Run4 are
    rather similar and should be easy to align. The algorithm will start with
    the "best" peakgroup overall (having the best probability score), assume
    this peakgroups is ``pg1_1`` from Run 1. The algorithm will then use the
    alignment Run1-Run2 to infer that ``pg2_1`` is the same signal as ``pg1_1``
    and add it to the group. Specifically, it will select the highest-scoring
    peakgroup within a narrow RT-window (max_rt_diff) in Run2 - note that if
    the RT-window is too wide, there is a certain chance of mis-matching, e.g.
    ``pg_2`` will be selected instead of ``pg2_1``.  The alignment Run2-Run3
    will be used to add ``pg3_1``. Then a bifurcation in the tree occurs and
    Run3-Run4 as well as Run3-Run5 will be used to infer the identity of
    ``pg4_1`` and ``pg5_1`` and add them to the cluster.  In the end, the
    algorithm will report (pg1_1, pg2_1, ``pg3_1``, ``pg4_1``, ``pg5_1``) as a
    consistent cluster across multiple runs. This process can be repeated with
    the next best peakgroup that is not yet part of a cluster (e.g. ``pg1_2``)
    until no more peakgroups are left (no more peakgroups having a score below
    fdr_cutoff).

    Note how the algorithm only used binary alignments and purely local
    alignments of the runs that are most close to each other. This stands in
    contrast to approaches where a single reference is picked and then used for
    alignment which might align runs that are substantially different. On the
    other hand, a single error at one edge in the tree will propagate itself
    and could lead to whole subtrees that are wrongly aligned.
