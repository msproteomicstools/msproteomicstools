    Parameter estimation object

    fdr is computed (which is then taken as the "aim"). For this "aim" of decoy
    percentage, the class will try to estimate an fdr_cutoff such that the
    percentage of decoy precursors in the final reported result will correspond
    to the "aim".

    precursors that are identified in min_runs above the fdr_cutoff will be
