The following should produce a GUI window with a single transition and a picked peak:

$ python gui/AlignmentGUI.py  --in test/data/gui/dataset1.yaml 
$ python gui/AlignmentGUI.py  --in test/data/gui/dataset1.csv test/data/gui/dataset1.chrom.mzML 

The following should produce a GUI window with 3 runs and 2 peptides (one of which has 2 charge states):

$ python gui/AlignmentGUI.py  --in test/data/gui/dataset2_* --fileType simple
